## **About This Repository**

This repository is used to store all documentation, notes, findings, and setup details related to our environment configuration and system troubleshooting.
We’re currently working on setting up a stable workflow for running the Exo software stack, configuring networking between systems, and testing GPU hardware across multiple machines.

## **What This Repo Contains**

* Environment setup notes
* Issues we discovered on Windows, Python versions, and WSL
* Network configuration attempts and observations
* Hardware-related findings (GPUs, connectivity, limitations)
* Any additional references or logs we collect during testing

## **Purpose**

The goal of this repo is to keep everything organized in one place so the team can:

* Track what we’ve tried
* Document what works and what doesn’t
* Maintain a clear record of system behavior
* Use this as a reference when fixing issues or planning next steps
